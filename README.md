# Monsterbrew GPT Cloud Function

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to write and deploy a simple Google Cloud Function (Firebase Function) accompanied by an OpenAPI description. The primary functionality of this function is to process text and return a URL after performing specific actions. It's designed to serve as an example of how such functions can be utilized as Actions in Custom GPTs.

## Functionality

The `index.js` file contains 2 Cloud Functions. One is named `createHomebrew`. This function:

1. **Validates the Request**: It ensures that the incoming request is a POST method and checks for the presence of required content in the request body.
2. **Processes the Text**: The function then uses Puppeteer to automate browser actions. It navigates to a specific website, inputs the received text, and performs certain actions to generate a URL.
3. **Responds with a URL**: Finally, the function returns this URL as a response to the initial request.

The other function, `privacyPolicy`, serves a static .txt file that you can use in your GPT.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying this function, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js installed
- Firebase CLI installed and configured
- Google Cloud account and Firebase project set up

## Setup and Deployment

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in the project directory to install required packages (`firebase-functions`, `puppeteer-core`, `chrome-aws-lambda`).
2. **Deploy to Firebase**: Use the command `firebase deploy --only functions` to deploy the function to your Firebase project.
3. **Make Privacy Policy public**: If you are creating a public GPT, you will need a public privacy policy. To remove the auth from this endpoint, you can run the following command:
`gcloud functions add-iam-policy-binding privacyPolicy --member="allUsers" --role="roles/cloudfunctions.invoker"`

## OpenAPI Description

The `openapi.json` file in the repository provides a detailed description of the API implemented by the Cloud Function. This includes information about the endpoints, request methods, expected request body format, and response structure.

## Usage

To use this function:

1. **Send a POST Request**: The request should be sent to the function's URL provided by Firebase after deployment.
2. **Include Content in Request Body**: The `content` key in the request body must contain the text to be processed.
3. **Receive the URL**: The function will return a URL in its response upon successful processing.
